# D3 Deduper TODO

## UI Flow (Phase 4)
- Show condensed weapon cards by default on "Your Weapons" page (image + Copies / Owned perks / Possible perks / Completion).
- On weapon click, switch to a focused view that shows only the selected weapon’s punch-card matrix and hides all other weapons.

## Perk Matrix Columns
- Fix column order to: Intrinsic Traits, Barrel, Magazine, Left Trait, Right Trait, Origin Trait.
- Remove the Kill Tracker/Memento column from the punch-card display.

## Perk Deduping
- Remove duplicate perks in columns 2–6 (treat enhanced perks as canonical and hide non-enhanced duplicates).

## Later
- Add masterwork column support.
